# Linear System Solver Modulo a Prime

This repository contains a small solver for systems of linear equations
with coefficients in \(\mathbb{Z}_p\), where \(p\) is a prime.  It
supports both a terminal interface and a minimal web-based calculator
suitable for hosting on GitHub Pages.

## Features

* core algorithm in `solver/alg.py`; no dependencies other than
  the standard library
* command-line tool (`python -m solver` or via `solver.cli`) that can
  read a matrix interactively, from a file, or from a pipe
* static web page (`docs/index.html`) with a JavaScript port of the
  algorithm – perfect for `.github.io` pages

## Installation

You can use the package directly from the source directory:

```sh
python3 -m venv .venv        # optional virtual env
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .              # later, if packaging added
```


## Command‑line usage

```sh
# interactive mode
python -m solver -p 7 -i

# read matrix from file
python -m solver -p 13 -f matrix.txt

# read from standard input
cat matrix.txt | python -m solver -p 5
```

The matrix file should contain one row per equation; each row must
have the coefficients followed by the constant term, separated by
spaces.

### Example

```
$ cat matrix.txt
1 1 2
1 6 0

$ python -m solver -p 7 -f matrix.txt
solution: [2, 0]
```

## Web interface

Open `docs/index.html` in a browser or host the contents of the
`docs/` directory using GitHub Pages.  You can point the Pages source to
`/docs` via the repository settings and the page will be available at
`https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/`.

The page allows you to paste a matrix and a prime modulus, then click
"Solve" to see the result.

## Development

* tests can be added under `tests/` using ``pytest``
* the algorithm is written to keep mutation local; helper functions
  are pure and easily ported to other languages
